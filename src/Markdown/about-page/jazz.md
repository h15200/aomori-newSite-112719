He has also toured extensively in Japan with the New York Jazz Expressway with saxophonist Antonio Hart, trumpet player Michael Philip Mossman, and drummer Jean Jackson. Hideakiâ€™s jazz record Glue features original compositions and arrangements on both saxophone and clarinet. Recent collaborators include Ambrose Akinmusire, and the funk band Scary Pockets.
